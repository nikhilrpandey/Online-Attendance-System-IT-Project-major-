Internet Technologies Major Project

Attendance-System
=================

The project is meant to create an advanced attendance taking system to help teachers, 
students and college administration by automating the entire process. It is designed keeping 
scalability and code- reusability in mind, which means that the same project can be altered 
by changing few variables to get desired results. Furthermore, thereâ€™s scope of adding more 
functionality without disturbing any of the existing one. This is made possible by using 
Object Oriented Programming, a Modular for designing web service, and following large 
parts of MVC model. This allows us to extend the project to mobile applications and other environments.


Brief overview of the technology:
Front end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

HTML: HTML is used to create and save web document. E.g. Notepad/Notepad++
